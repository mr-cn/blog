The disease, from China, which has now killed at least 2006 people has caused all people to worry about the development of China.

To avoid the spread, people are now strongly advised to stay at home, even forcibly in some critical areas. Staying at home means no consuming, no selling, and no development on economic. Because of the coming spring festival, many delivery services are not available, thus making people can’t do shopping online too. With trading affected, many people in critical areas can’t even buy enough foods. In such a situation, many normal items increase in price.

The news might be even worse that, to control the spread, the government extended the duration of the holiday. If not, people need to come to the big cities from their hometown, and what are brought to the cities are not only the people, also the virus, which will bring the situation completely out of control. But, the company should continuously pay for the salary. Many small companies lack of cash flow actually, so it will be a big challenge for them.
